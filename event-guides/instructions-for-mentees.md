# Instructions for Mentees

Link to this from emails to mentees.

Thanks for participating as a mentee! Here’s what we hope you will do during and after the event.

When you arrive, say hi! For many of the mentees, this will be the first conference they attend, maybe their first tech conference ever. See if you can find your mentor match.

During the event, we’ll do something called Speed Networking. Every few minutes, you will get the chance to chat with one of the mentors. You can ask some questions, or they might kick things off. There’s an app you can use to randomly generate a question to ask, if you are not sure where to begin. The goal is to help everyone get to know each other a little bit, and for you to get some practice.

During the conference, try to meet up with your mentor. For example, maybe you will be introduced to your friends and colleagues, and you could meet up at the conference lunch. To make the most of the experience, reach out proactively to your mentor or fellow mentees to make some plans. There’s also a general chat channel on the Ember Discord where open evening plans get made, if you want to expand your network!

After the conference, it’s up to you whether you continue chatting, but we hope that you do! For example, even a quarterly check-in can go a long way towards building your career and skills.

In general, a mentee might...
- Keep a list of things they would like to chat about
- Share updates if/when they follow through with a mentor’s suggestion, to let them know how it went
- Reach out proactively to their mentor
- Challenge themselves to try new things
- Work towards being a mentor themselves someday

Remember that just like friendships come in many different forms, mentoring relationships have a lot of variation, and that’s ok!

Thank you so much for participating! If you have any feedback about this program, please get in touch.
