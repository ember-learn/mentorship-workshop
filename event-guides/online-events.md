# Online Events

Ahead of the online event you will be added to a Calendar Invite that will include a link to a Google Meet call. You can join in your browser of you will also be able to dial into the call by phone with a US number.

This is a very informal call and it is mostly to ask as many questions as you want about the programme and what to expect. At all points you can chime in and ask a question but we have a rough outline for the call to help get the conversation started and cover some of the points that people might not know about: 

- Introductions
- Info about special events & groups (Discord, POC, WHW)
- Been to EmberConf before?
- Things that helped us break in, things people did to help out
- Types of mentors and outcomes
- Ongoing mentorship program
- Open Q&A

It is always worth reminding people to join the Discord channel for the Mentoring Workshop so that they can ask any more questions over there.
