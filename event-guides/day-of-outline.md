# Day-of Outline

Use this to guide your event on the day it is happening!

## Supplies checklist

- nametags
- markers
- colorful tape to show the rotation flow
- enough tables & chairs
- icebreaker supplies
- speaker for background music before the event begins
- snacks and drinks, if applicable
- some type of noise-making device, like a bell

## Prep

Leave yourself some time to put arrows on the floor and lay out nametag supplies.

## Outline

This outline assumes a 1.5 hour event.

1. Welcome! Introduce yourself and share an overview (5 mins)
2. Icebreaker of your choice (15 mins). See `event-guides/icebreakers` for ideas
3. Speed networking (1 hour) - Mentors and mentees will have a short time to ask each other questions. All mentees will talk with all mentors before the event is over! How many mentees do you have? Take that number, and divide 60 minutes by it. That's how long each segment of speed networking should last. For example, a group of 20 pairs of mentors/mentees will rotate every 3 minutes. Have the mentees change spots when you ring a bell or sound a chime.
4. Wrap-up (10 mins) - share suggestions of how attendees can continue participating. See `event-guides/instructions-for-mentors` for ideas.
