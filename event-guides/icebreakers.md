# Icebreakers

The most important aspects of a good icebreaker are that they are energizing and inclusive.

Before you choose any activity, consider how someone would participate if they have a disability, bad memory, are very quiet, don't speak a language as well as others, etc. Would they be able to fully participate regardless? Is there anything that would make someone feel bad if they came from a difficult background, different economic statuses, uncommon family structure, etc? For example, asking "are you more like your mom or dad?" assumes that someone knows their parents, makes it weird for people who have two moms instead, or causes people to recall painful memories like deaths or breakups, etc. Remember, this is supposed to be fun!

## Good icebreaker ideas for adults

- Treasure box - Gather many small items (enough for all participants plus some extras). Ask each participant to choose an object, but don't say why. Once everyone has selected one, they are asked to share one way that they are similar to the item, or one thing that they are good at that relates to it. For example, someone who chooses a blue lego brick may say that they are cool under pressure, or they are consistent, or enjoy building things, etc.
- [Snowball fight](https://blog.sli.do/10-ice-breakers-to-kick-off-your-conference/) - people write down one of their greatest challenges on a piece of paper. They crumple it up and try to throw it at a target in the middle of the room (an empty cup on a table, for example). Then everyone picks up a "snowball" and reads it aloud.
- [10 things in common](https://www.tinypulse.com/blog/sk-work-icebreaker-games) - form small groups, and give them the challenge of identifying some number of things that they have in common.
- [One word](https://www.tinypulse.com/blog/sk-work-icebreaker-games) - in one word, describe: yourself, your workplace, your travel to get here, your greatest challenge, etc.
- [Year of the coin](https://www.govloop.com/community/blog/9-easy-icebreakers-meetings/) - gather small coins, one for each participant. They share what they were doing during that year.
- [Paper airplane game](https://www.govloop.com/community/blog/9-easy-icebreakers-meetings/) - write down something about yourself, make it into a paper airplane, launch it, and then try to find the person who it belongs to.
- [Link building](https://www.eventmanagerblog.com/ice-breakers#work) - create a chain of things people have in common
- [Introduction interviews](https://blog.sli.do/10-ice-breakers-to-kick-off-your-conference/) - instead of introducing yourself, ask a partner some questions and introduce them like you're an emcee!
