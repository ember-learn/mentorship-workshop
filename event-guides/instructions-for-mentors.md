# Instructions for Mentors

Thanks for volunteering to be a mentor! Here’s what we hope you will do during and after the event.

When you arrive, say hi! For many of the mentees, this will be the first conference they attend, maybe their first tech conference ever! See if you can find your mentee match.

During the event, we’ll do something called Speed Networking. Every few minutes, the mentees will rotate and you’ll talk to someone new. They will ask you some questions, or you can kick things off. There’s an app you can use to randomly generate a question to ask, if you are not sure where to begin. The goal is to help everyone get to know each other a little bit, and for mentees to get some practice.

During the conference, try to meet up with your mentee. Introduce them to your friends and colleagues, and meet up at the conference lunch. Consider inviting them to come along in any informal dinner plans too. The goal is to help them feel welcome and not lost in the giant sea of people.

After the conference, it’s up to you whether you continue chatting, but we hope that you do! For example, even a quarterly check-in can go a long way towards someone advancing their career and you building your own skills as a mentor.

In general, a good mentor...
- Uses active listening skills
- Asks questions that help their mentee explore challenges in a new way (as opposed to just giving advice)
- Reaches out proactively to see how someone is doing, especially a few weeks after the last conversation
- Helps the mentee make good connections to other people and resources
- Empowers their mentee to become a mentor themselves someday

Remember that just like friendships come in many different forms, mentoring relationships have a lot of variation, and that’s ok!

Thank you so much for your time and effort! If you have any feedback about this program, please get in touch.
